	<h1>About <span>Me</span></h1> 
    <p>I'am Lieghei Emilton Aquino. A student of ICCT Colleges. Mastering
the course of BSIT. At first I was unsure about taking this course because 
I have little knowledge about coding itself. As I love playing video games (particularly in online computer games)
I started to notice that I really wanted to be an IT specialist and that's why I selected this course after Senior
High School. I'm a bit slow learning the lessons but I always work hard until I finally understand and perform the
lesson by myself.</p>
